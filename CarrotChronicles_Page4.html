                Celery had taught the carrot a plethora of things. In effect, the carrot was quite educated on a great array of topics despite living down at the bottom of the sea.  
                <br><br>
                As mentioned before, Celery the rabbit lived in quite a different environment; she lived in a delivery truck. She never went hungry as the truck drivers kept her well-fed, and they sometimes cleaned her fur and presented her with toys. Living in the truck was a joy for Celery. 
                <br><br>
                As you might have guessed, Celery was rather well-read for a rabbit. This largely owed to the fact that more often than not, the truck was piled high with school books. 
                <br><br>
                Which box do you think Celery is in?

                While the discovery of a talking carrot had initially left her stupefied, she soon learnt to roll with it. The two had already been penpals for a while before this revelation, and when her friendâ€™s identity had been made known to her, she thought it over long and hard, before deciding that a carrot for a friend was not a bad thing at all.

                Now, you might be curious how their exchange of letters could even take place. How does one send a letter from the bottom of the sea to a delivery truck, and vice versa?

                It was a fishing pole that did the job.
