            <p>The carrot did need the bubble, or at least, that’s what he thought; he’d never actually tried stepping out for fear that perhaps things would go horribly wrong, and then he’d regret it. <br><br>
                It was unnecessary to step out of the bubble at any rate. The bubble contained everything that the carrot needed. A taco television, sushi sofa, banana bookshelf, and air. <br>

                Yes, air was very important indeed. The carrot needed it for respiration. That’s how living things convert food into energy. <br><br>
                <span class=question >The air around you is made up of around 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 0.04% carbon dioxide and a small percentage of some other gases. Which component of air is needed for respiration?<span>

            <p class="storyText2" id=CeleryIntro >But as an organism respires, it takes in oxygen and gives out carbon dioxide. This presents a problem: eventually the bubble would be full of carbon dioxide and depleted of oxygen, which would have in store rather unpleasant consequences for the carrot. <br><br>
                However, this particular carrot was quite the resourceful fellow. Having built an electrolytic cell in his bubble, he was able to make excellent use of the water around him, separating it into oxygen and hydrogen. <br><br>
                Celery, Carrot’s friend, was the one who taught him to do this. No, Celery was not a stick of celery. She was a rabbit with a velvety black coat and beady black eyes that lived in a delivery truck. But more about that later. First, here is some of what Celery had taught Carrot.

            <p class=electrolyticCelltext>
                An electrolytic cell is basically an electrical circuit that tiny things called electrons flow through, like little cars on a little highway. That flow of electrons is called electricity. Electricity is a type of energy, and with energy, you can do stuff!
                <br><br>
                In an electrolytic cell, electrical energy is used to cause a non-spontaneous chemical reaction (that means the reaction wouldn’t have happened on its own). This reaction happens because of the transfer of electrons. 
                <br><br>
                <b class=darker>So what are electrons?</b><br>They are <em>very very very </em>small, extremely miniscule things that are part of an atom. 
                What are atoms? Atoms are the little pieces that make up matter. They’re like tiny puzzle pieces, so small that you can’t see them. The electrons are one part of the atom. That’s what’s called a subatomic particle. Subatomic particles are the extra tiny puzzle pieces that make up the tiny puzzle pieces. 
                <br><br>
                <span class=darker>Atoms can lose or gain electrons by giving them to other atoms. </span>It’s like giving presents to your friends from time to time. Some atoms are more greedy than others; those will snatch up the atoms from their friends very easily. Some aren’t really interested in electrons, and just let their friends have them. An excess of electrons gives an atom a negative charge (maybe because they were too greedy) and a lack of electrons gives an atom a positive charge.
